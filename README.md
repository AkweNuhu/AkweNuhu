Civil Engineer | Offshore & Subsea Projects | Pipeline Integrity | Data-Driven Problem Solver

I’m a civil, subsea & pipeline engineer, passionate about offshore oil & gas development, specializing in subsea construction, FPSO systems, and pipeline integrity assessment. I apply engineering standards like ASME B31.G and DNV-RP-F101, and I enjoy working on data analytics projects that improve asset reliability and operational efficiency. Currently exploring how tools like Power BI and Excel can enhance engineering decision-making.
